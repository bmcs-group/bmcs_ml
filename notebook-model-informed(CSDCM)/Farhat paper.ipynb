    "The computational framework presented in [22] for building and training mechanics-informed data-driven ANNs for the constitutive modeling of nonlinear elastic materials distinguishes itself from alternatives by the simultaneous enforcement, in a computationally efficient manner, of the following mechanics-based hard constraints on the network architecture and loss function:\n",
    "- Dynamic stability. In the absence of any dissipative mechanism, preventing an uncontrolled growth of the kinetic energy of an elastic material requires such a material to be more precisely hyperelastic. That is, the stresses that may develop in the material must derive from a strain energy density function $W$. This constraint is simply enforced by using the ANN to represent the strain energy density function rather than the stress. Consequently, the output of the ANN is chosen to be $W$; and the loss function is formulated in terms of the gradient of $W$ with respect to its input (determined below), rather than its output $W$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Objectivity. To be objective, the strain energy density function $W$ should be invariant to orthogonal transformations of the frame of reference. To achieve this, $W$ must be expressible in terms of the Green-Lagrange strain $\\boldsymbol{E} \\in \\operatorname{Sym}_d^2(\\mathbb{R}),{ }^2$ where $d$ is the dimensionality of the problem (one-, two-, or three-dimensional). Consequently, the input to the ANN is chosen to be $\\boldsymbol{E}$. Since dynamic stability requires hyperelasticity, the output stress measure is chosen to be the energy conjugate of $\\boldsymbol{E}$ - that is, the second Piola Kirchhoff stress tensor $S \\in \\operatorname{Sym}_d^2(\\mathbb{R})$.\n",
    "- Material stability. Material stability characterizes a material which, under small loads, cannot experience arbitrarily large deformations. It is ensured by the ellipticity of $\\bar{W}(\\boldsymbol{F})$ - that is, the strain energy density function expressed in terms of the deformation gradient $F \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$ - which itself is implied by the convexity of $W$ in the Green-Lagrange strain $E \\in \\operatorname{Sym}_d^2(\\mathbb{R})$, when the material is in a tensile state [22]. The convexity of $W(\\boldsymbol{E})$ leads to a symmetric positive definite elasticity tensor. Unlike that of $\\bar{W}(\\boldsymbol{F})$, which necessarily excludes the physically reasonable growth condition $\\bar{W} \\rightarrow \\infty$ as $\\operatorname{det} \\mathbf{F} \\rightarrow 0^{+}$and prevents instability phenomena such as buckling (see [22]), the convexity of $W(\\boldsymbol{E})$ is not too restrictive. The convexity of the ANN representation of the output $W$ with respect to the input $E$ is enforced using the restrictions of Input Convex Neural Networks [29].\n",
    "- Consistency. In [22] and in this work, consistency refers to the preservation of rigid body modes. That is, a material undergoing zero strain should experience zero stress. This essential property is enforced by adding a linear correction to the ANN output $W$ whose slope is equal to the negative of the ANN gradient at the origin.\n",

    "# 3. Constitutive modeling of nonlinear viscoelasticity\n",
    "\n",
    "Viscoelastic materials exhibit both viscous and elastic characteristics. Viscoelasticity manifests itself in a constitutive law through two main mechanisms: strain-rate dependence; and hysteresis. Thus, unlike an elastic counterpart, a viscoelastic material law cannot be represented by a function of the instantaneous strain only. Instead, it should be represented by a function which, at any time $t$, depends on the entire strain history preceding $t$. For example, a candidate representation of the instantaneous second Piola Kirchhoff stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{S}$ associated with a viscoelastic material is\n",

However, the above candidate representation is too general as it also applies to plastic, viscoplastic - and for that matter, any other path-dependent material law. In other words, it is not sufficiently specific to characterize a viscoelastic material. Indeed, unlike a plastic material (for example), a viscoelastic material experiences fading memory [30] and therefore does not experience permanent deformations or residual stresses as a result of its strain history. Furthermore, the overly general representation (1) poses difficulties to regression-based constitutive modeling. To begin, the number of inputs to the sought-after ANN-based model associated with a time-discretization of the strain history - and thus, the number of model parameters - can be prohibitively large to train the model. In addition, the online execution of a trained model - say, within a FE analysis - may require a significant amount of data storage and CPU resources. Over and above all of this, a representation such as (1) is difficult to interpret and thus difficult to inform with mechanics-based constraints."

    "For all the above reasons, a more concise and yet sufficiently expressive representation of nonlinear viscoelasticity is sought after in this paper. To this end, it is noted that it is tempting to achieve this objective by simply adding a strain-rate dependence to a standard elastic model. However, that would fail to capture the relaxation effect commonly observed in viscoelastic materials. It is also noted that a commonly used constitutive model for linear viscoelasticity is the standard linear solid (SLS) model, which draws on the spring dashpot analogy to account for both dependences on the stress rate and strain rate. This model leads to a parametric linear relationship between the stress, strain, stress rate, and strain rate. Specifically, it consists of a first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the stress, in which the strain and strain rate appear as source terms. In the nonlinear setting however, a more sophisticated model such as that proposed in this paper is required.\n",

Fig. 2 highlights the predictive capability of the constructed ANN-based material model - that is, its performance for an \"unseen\" strain path - which is impressive, considering that training is performed in this case on only two strain paths. Collectively, the results reported in Figs. 1 and 2 demonstrate the ability of the ANN-based model to learn the structure of the constitutive law underlying the training data, rather than just memorizing it. Without the mechanics-informed constraints developed in this paper, this task would require a significantly larger amount of data and many more training strain paths. Furthermore, the aforementioned results suggest a potential equivalence between the nonlinear internal variable approach adopted in the proposed framework and nonlinear kemel convolutions."
