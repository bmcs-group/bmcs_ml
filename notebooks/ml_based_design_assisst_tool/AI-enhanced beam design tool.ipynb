    "This study endeavors to harness the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in tackling challenges encountered in the design process of carbon reinforced concrete beams. The aim is to confront the intricacies inherent in design issues characterized by a multitude of parameters and requirements. It recognizes that artificial neural networks (ANNs) hold the capacity to uncover patterns within vast structural design datasets, establishing connections between input variables and output parameters essential for engineering objectives.\n",
    "In conventional design frameworks, validating limit states and functional requirements relies on completing the entire design process. As a result, the sequential inversion of design expectations is of paramount significance.  While forward design is feasible using conventional approaches, performing backward design where some input parameters and selected target outputs are pre-assigned poses challenges, as all outputs can only be calculated through forward design. Challenges arise from intricacies inherent to recalculating and adjusting parameters\n",
    "during retroactive application of constraints. This step requires multiple adjustments of input parameters and recalculations of the outputs, adding a layer of difficulty to the process."

    "Phase 1: Initially, we frame the challenge as the design of a rectangular beam element at the cross-sectional level. Our goal is to determine which permissible design parameters from the defined design space best satisfy defined ultimate limit states (CC/TC/Balanced), with the input parameter being the moment capacity. We employ black box neural network (NN) and/or physics-informed neural network (PINN) methods to tackle this challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phase 2: As we progress, our approach will evolve to address the complexities inherent in designing the beam along its entire length. The framework offers real-time interactive feedback to explore a range of CRC beam design scenarios. It takes into consideration various geometric and material parameters, along with critical limit states such as maximum crack opening and deflection, serving as control factors. Furthermore, constraints are imposed, including maximum material utilization and carbon emissions."

    "Given the absence of a unique solution mapping moment capacity to the addmisible design parameters, direct training of a neural network (NN) is impractical to map a single output to a set of inputs (design space). Therefore, a feed forward NN (FFNN) should be used, followed by accuracy and validation tests within the design space. An inversion of the NN can then be attempted. I propose to first construct an NN that uses either a black-box or a physical method to translate input parameters from the design space into the moment capacity of the section. This approach allows a comprehensive investigation of the relationship between inputs and outputs and facilitates the subsequent inversion process."
